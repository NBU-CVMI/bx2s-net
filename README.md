# BX2S-Net
This repository contains the code for the paper "BX2S-Net: Learning to Reconstruct 3D Spinal Structures from Bi-planar X-ray Images".

## Notes

- The program entry is the main.py file.
- config.py is the configuration file where you can reconfigure the program run parameters (for example, custom dataset paths).
- The program defaults to train mode, and you can switch to test mode by specifying the model weight file path with the --weight-path parameter.
